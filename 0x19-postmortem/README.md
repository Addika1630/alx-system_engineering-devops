Issue Summary:
Duration: July 15, 2023, 09:30 AM - July 15, 2023, 11:45 AM (UTC-5)
Impact: Slowdown of our web application; 20% of users experienced performance degradation.
Root Cause: Database connection pool saturation due to a misconfigured setting.

Timeline:

Issue Detected: July 15, 2023, 09:30 AM (UTC-5) through monitoring alerts.
Actions Taken: Investigated web server logs, checked application metrics, and analyzed database performance.
Assumptions: Initially thought it might be a server resource constraint or a sudden traffic spike.
Misleading Path: Redirected focus on scaling the server instances which did not alleviate the issue.
Escalation: Escalated to the Database Operations team and Senior DevOps Engineer.
Resolution: Discovered misconfigured database connection pool settings causing saturation.
Issue Fixed: Optimized the connection pool size, implemented connection recycling, and tested changes.
Root Cause and Resolution:
The issue stemmed from a misconfigured database connection pool setting. The pool was initially set to a fixed size which caused it to saturate during peak traffic, leading to sluggish response times for our web application. This saturation resulted in connection timeouts, leading to delayed responses.

To address the issue, we reconfigured the connection pool size dynamically, based on traffic patterns. Additionally, we implemented connection recycling to free up unused connections, ensuring the pool remained efficient. These changes were carefully tested in a controlled environment to ensure no unintended consequences.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:

Automated Scaling: Develop an automated scaling mechanism for the database connection pool that adapts to traffic fluctuations.
Enhanced Monitoring: Implement real-time monitoring on connection pool health and response times to detect anomalies early.
Thorough Testing: Establish a comprehensive testing process for critical configuration changes to prevent production issues.
Documentation: Enhance documentation on system configurations to avoid similar misconfigurations in the future.
Training: Organize training sessions for the team on identifying and troubleshooting performance bottlenecks.
Tasks to Address the Issue:

Patch the connection pool settings in all environments (production, staging, development).
Implement automated connection pool scaling based on traffic patterns.
Enhance monitoring with specific alerting thresholds for connection pool utilization.
Document the new connection pool configuration and share it with the team.
Conduct a post-implementation review to ensure the changes effectively mitigate future incidents.
